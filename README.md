# SQL Retail Sales Analysis

## Overview
This project analyses an order-level retail dataset using SQL to explore sales performance, profitability, and demand trends.

## Dataset
- Source: Kaggle – EuroMart Stores Order Data (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/braniac2000/retail-dataset/data)
- The dataset contains information on orders, products, customers, sales, profit, and geography.

## Key Questions
- Which categories drive the most revenue?
- How does profitability vary by category?
- How is sales distributed across countries?
- What trends and seasonal patterns exist over time?

## Key Insights
- Office Supplies is the largest revenue-driving category, accounting for approximately 43% of total sales followed by Technology and Furniture. Although Office Supplies drives the highest revenue, its profit margin (18.13%) is lower than Technology (21%). This suggests that while Office Supplies generates volume-led revenue, Technology delivers more efficient profit per unit of sales. Improving margins within Office Supplies could have a significant impact on overall profitability given its large revenue share.

- Sales are highly concentrated, with the top 5 countries accounting for approximately 84.59%. The remaining 10 countries contribute relatively low sales, indicating potential for market expansion.
  
- Monthly sales show a clear upward trend over time, indicating growth in overall demand. Sales Exhibit seasonal patterns, with noticeable peaks during specific periods. Sustained growth combined with seasonal peaks suggests the need for effective capacity and inventory planning to meet periods of higher demand.

## Tools Used
- SQL (SQLite)
- DBeaver
